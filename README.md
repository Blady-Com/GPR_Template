# Templates for GNAT project

Advanced Ada GNAT compiler users want to:

* obtain the best warnings during the compilation,
* benefit from the best runtime checks,
* optimize the execution of their Ada program.

To this end, [the GNAT guide on Blady](http://blady.pagesperso-orange.fr/Ressources/gnat-gpl.pdf) provides, for several years, a selection of options of the GNAT Ada compiler. These options are now directly available as GPR project templates.
